Subprocess is a library for safely and (relatively) easily working
launching processes with commands on Unix systems, with a focus on I/O.
It is intended to be easier to use than the `Unix` module.

There is extensive Odoc documentation, but it is no currently hosted
anywhere, so you will have to build it to read it at the moment. Expect
this to change soon.
