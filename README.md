Subprocess is a library for safely and (relatively) easily working
launching processes with commands on Unix systems. It is vaguely
inspired by Python's `subprocess` module, but do not expect it to have
quite the same API if you are familiar with that. It's intended to be
easier to use than the `Unix` module.

There is odoc documentation [here](https://ninjaaron.github.io/ocaml-subprocess/subprocess/Subprocess/index.html). It may be out of date. I should really be building it with a hook. [lib/subprocess.mli](lib/subprocess.mli)
is always the authoritative source.
